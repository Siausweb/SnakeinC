# **WWW** snake in C
 simple snake game by me 
 uses ncurses libary so make sure you have thatHE ARROW KEYS

 to build run this in the directory the files are in

 ```console
 sudo gcc app.c -o snake -lncurses
 ```

 then run 
 ```console
 ./snake
 ```


 game should run in terminal and idk how it works with windows
