# **WWW** snake in C
 simple snake game by me 
 uses ncurses libary so make sure you have that
 USE THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE

 to build run this in the directory the files are in

 ```console
 sudo gcc app.c -o snake -lncurses
 ```

 then run 
 ```console
 ./snake
 ```


 game should run in terminal and idk how it works with windows
